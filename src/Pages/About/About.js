                My name is David Shober, I'm currently working at BioFire Diognostics LLC.  "BioFire creates Comprehensive panels that take out the guess work, giving laboratories and healthcare providers a higher probability of identifying pathogens associated with infectious disease.
                Designed with the syndromic approach in mind, each panel combines a broad grouping of probable pathogenic causes into a single, rapid test."" I've worked for BioFire for two and a half years now. I currently live in Lake Point Utah,  I've lived here a little over a year.

                My goal is to make a career change into web development, I really enjoy making web applications from scratch and seeing what I can create. Although very challenging, seeing the end result of a web application completed from start to finish is exciting.
